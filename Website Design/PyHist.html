	Python first started with a general-purpose programming<br />
	language called ABC. ABC was created in the Netherlands,<br />
	and it’s greatest accomplishment was to influence Python’s<br />
	design.

 The idea of Python was created in the late 1980’s when Guido van<br />
 Rossum was working on an operating system called Amoeba. He also<br />
 worked on ABC, and said in an interview that he became frustrated<br />
 with the language because it had many problems. Rossum wanted to<br />
 create a language that contained most of ABC’s properties but without<br />
 all of it’s problems. So he worked on a scripting language with all<br />
 the parts of ABC he liked and a few of his own parts that have never<br />
 been seen in a programming language before.

<p></p>
<p class="info" style="border: 2px solid rgb(226, 255, 12);display: inline-block; position:relative;top:-350px; left:250px">
 In December, 1989, Rossum chose the name ‘Python’ for his language. <br />
 He chose this name because he was a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying<br />
 Circus, a British comedy series. Python was later released as a programming<br />
 language in 1991 as version 0.9.0. Then, in 1994, Python 1.0 was released.<br />
 Soon after that, Python 2.0 was released in October 2000, and for another<br />
 8 years, it flourished. Finally Python 3, or Py3k was released adding many<br />
 new features. Overall, Python is a very successful language, and how<br />
 easy it is to learn it makes it perfect for new programmers.
